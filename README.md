## Rescue Robot - Human Detection Module

# FYPII_ESP32S3_AI_1
This is an embedded AI module powered by ESP32S3 MCU. It is a part of my Final Year Project for my Electrical-Mechatronic degree. 
# OBJECTIVES
1. To create an object detection AI model for human detection in emergencies.
2. To run the model on a microcontroller which, in this project is an ESP32S3
3. To create a sound source localization algorithm.
# HUMAN DETECTION FLOW
1. The model is trained in Edge Impulse website/framework.
2. The model is uploaded to the MCU.
3. The MCU will signal the main MCU when a human is detected.
